## Communication

- Non-formal communication can happen across all communication channels, e.g.,
  our ["Account-bound token" TG channel](https://t.me/account_bound_tokens)
- A lot of discussion about "Soulbound tokens" is happening on the
  [RadicalExchange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/) Discord server.
- [Otterspace](https://www.otterspace.xyz/) is committing a significant portion
  of their current product iteration towards integrating the standard. So is
  [violet.co](https://violet.co/).
- However, for any formal communication regarding the standard document, make
  sure you leave a comment on the [official discussion thread on the Ethereum
  Magicians
  forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4973-account-bound-tokens/8825)!
  It is vital to appropriately document community sentiment and interest.
